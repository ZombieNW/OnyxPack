### _Datapack/Resourcepack Combination That Adds Various Content To Minecraft_
![Languages](https://badgen.net/badge/language/MCFunction/green)

## A Dumb (But Important) Ramble
This repo is all over the place. So I'll explain a little for context. I ran a Minecraft SMP from 2020-2022 called OnyxSMP. The Crown Jewel of the server was a custom datapack/resourcepack combination that added tons of custom content like beverages, food, and furniture. It evolved a lot and the way I challenged myself was by starting over every time we reset the map.

## Installation
I have no idea why you'd want to set this up other than if you played the original server and want to go back for memories. But there's a bit of setup required. So let's say you want to set Version 5 for 1.18.

Download the [NBT-Crafting API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nbt-crafting) that cooresponds with the MC version you want to download on a [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) server.
Once you've installed all that just add the cooresponding datapack to the server and load the cooresponding resourcepack.

## Usage
For Version 1-2, run the command /function onyx:give_manual
For Versions 3-5, I've supplied wikis that explain each addition in the directory.
