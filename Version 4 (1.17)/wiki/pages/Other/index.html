            <h2>Cherry Blossom Trees</h2>
			<p>Cherry Blossom Trees were depreciated. Their leaves will still function as blocks but saplings wont work and you can't obtain them anymore.</p>
            <h2>Spawners</h2>
            <p>Spawners are mineable, and you can ask a staff to change them how you need, however, some mobs are not allowed and is usually decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>
