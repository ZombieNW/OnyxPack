			<h2>Map Creation & Heads</h2>
			<p>
				You can now make use of Heads and Maps to decorate your builds.<br>
				Use /head to open a menu to select heads, easy as that! Maps however are not as easy.<br><br>
				For maps there are 3 commands.<br>
				/mapcreate [link]  -  To make a simple 1x1 map with the specified link.<br>
				/dithermap dither [link]  -  Similar to mapcreate except it uses dithering to make more accurate colors, just preference.<br>
				/multimap [width] [height] (fill/fit/stretch) (dither/none) [link]  -  The most complex of all, this command is used to make bigger maps. Width/Height are numbers, then choose the sizing and color method, and put the link at the end, easy enough.<br>
				AND I SWEAR, IF ANY OF YOU MAKE NSFW MAPS, INSTANT BAN, IM LOOKING AT YOU CREATOR
