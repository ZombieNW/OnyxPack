			<h2>Tables</h2>
			<p>It's a nice table! What's not to love, you can place blocks, item frames, and anything you can normally put on a normal block. AND, if you activate the table with redstone, it act's like a trapdoor. Remember, it's a feature, not a bug. <br>Recipe:</p>

			<p>Update! This feature now works with any type of wood and produces different chairs.</p>
			<h2>Chairs</h2>
			<p>You can sit in them! However, there are issues with placement if there are multiple people around, it judges the way the chair aims based off the closest player. <br>Recipe:</p>

			<p>Update! This feature now works with any type of wood and produces different tables.</p>
			<h2>Lamp</h2>
			<p>A slightly more expensive recipe, but it does a nice job of looking pretty and lighting up the room!<br>Recipe:</p>
