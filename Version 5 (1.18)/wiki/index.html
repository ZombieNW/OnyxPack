			<h1>Hi! Welcome to Onyx SMP</h1>
			<p>We are a Minecraft server dedicated to giving a vanilla feeling server but with lot's of new additions. <br> Lately we've decided to take a newer approach to the way we develop our additions, and that is by making a definative version that gets less updates, but the updates are more quality and last even into the next season, only with occational features being taken in and out. This page is the wiki page for all the new features we've added. On the side bar are links to important pages.</p>
