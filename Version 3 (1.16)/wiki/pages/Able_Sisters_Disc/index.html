        <h2>Able Sisters Disc</h2>
        <p>Able Sisters is one of the three <a href="../Music_Discs/index.html">Music Discs</a> added to Onyxpack.</p>
        <h4>Credit</h4>
        <p>This song was originally composed by Nintendo for Animal Crossing: Wild World. The Onyxpack version is a cover of this song sequenced by David Josu and mastered by ZombieNW. If any of these people/groups would like the song to be removed from Onyxpack, that action will be performed immediately.</p>
        <h4>Aquiring</h4>
        <p>You can find Able Sisters discs as you would most other discs, getting a skeleton to kill a creeper. A music disc farming tutorial is <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Music_disc_farming">here</a>. A simple diagram bellow also shows the basic process.</p>
